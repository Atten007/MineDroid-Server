# MineDroid-Server
This repository is for my Minecraft: Java Edition Server app for Android (4.1 and newer). It requires at least 256MB ram to run Minecraft Papermc 1.8.8 and at least 1GB RAM to run Minecraft papermc 1.18.1.

# Other Apps

For the Java Edition launcher for Android see "MineDroid-Launcher"!

# About

With this app, you can create a Minecraft: PaperMC server for free on your android device. Your device must run at least Android 4.1 and it must at least have 128MB of RAM. It should only run MineDroid and not other apps.

# Requirements

* 5GB free disk space
* 128MB RAM for Minecraft: PaperMC 1.7.10, 1.8.8 and 1.9.4
* 256MB RAM for Minecraft: PaperMC 1.10.2, 1.11.2, 1.12.2 and 1.13.2
* 512MB RAM for Minecraft: PaperMC 1.14.4, 1.15.2 and 1.16.5
* 1GB RAM for Minecraft: PaperMC 1.17.1 and 1.18.1
* Java 1.8.0 for Minecraft: PaperMC 1.7.10 up to 1.16.5
* Java 16 for Minecraft: PaperMC 1.17.1
* Java 17 for Minecraft: PaperMC 1.18.1

# Very important notes

* Minecraft 1.17 requires at least Java 16 and Minecraft 1.18 requires at least Java 17.
* On some very, very old Android devices, you can only create a Minecraft: PaperMC server for 1.16.5 and below because these devices do not support Java 11 and up.
* This software is in a very early alpha stadium and it can be discontinued at any time.
* There's also the application "MineDroid-Launcher". This app is also from me and with it, you can launch Minecraft: Java Edition on Android devices!
